Air expands when heated and gets compressed when cooled. This results in variations in the atmospheric pressure. The result is that it causes the movement of air from high pressure to low pressure, setting the air in motion. You already know that air in horizontal motion is wind. Atmospheric pressure also determines when the air will rise or sink. The wind redistributes the heat and moisture across the planet, thereby, maintaining a constant temperature for the planet as a whole. The vertical rising of</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">moist air cools it down to form the clouds and bring precipitation. This chapter has been</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">devoted to explain the causes of pressure</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">differences, the forces that control the</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">atmospheric circulation, the turbulent pattern of wind, the formation of air masses, the disturbed weather when air masses interact with each other and the phenomenon of violent tropical storms.</span></p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB">Do you realise that our body is subjected to a lot of air pressure. As one moves up the air gets varified and one feels breathless.</p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The weight of a column of air contained in a unit area from the mean sea level to the top of the atmosphere is called the</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">atmospheric pressure</span><span xml:lang="en-US">. The atmospheric pressure is expressed in units of milibar. At sea level the average atmospheric pressure is 1,013.2 milibar. Due to gravity the air at the surface is denser and hence has higher pressure. Air pressure is measured with the help of a mercury barometer or the aneroid barometer. Consult your book,</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">Practical Work in Geography — Part I</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">(NCERT, 2006) and learn about these instruments. The pressure decreases with height. At any elevation it varies from place to place and its variation is the primary cause of air motion, i.e. wind which moves from high pressure areas to low pressure areas.</span></p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">In the lower atmosphere the pressure decreases rapidly with height. The decrease amounts to about 1 mb for each 10 m increase in elevation. It does not always decrease at the same rate.

    <h4 class="heading2 para-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-GB">Forces Affecting the Velocity and Direction of Wind</h4>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB">You already know that the air is set in motion due to the differences in atmospheric pressure. The air in motion is called wind. The wind blows from high pressure to low pressure. The wind at the surface experiences friction. In addition, rotation of the earth also affects the wind movement. The force exerted by the rotation of the earth is known as the Coriolis force. Thus, the horizontal winds near the earth surface respond to the combined effect of three forces – the pressure gradient force, the frictional force and the Coriolis force. In addition, the gravitational force acts downward.</p>

    <p class="heading3" xml:lang="en-GB">Pressure Gradient Force</p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB">The differences in atmospheric pressure produces a force. The rate of change of pressure with respect to distance is the pressure gradient. The pressure gradient is strong where the isobars are close to each other and is weak where the isobars are apart.</p>

    <p class="heading3" xml:lang="en-GB">Frictional Force</p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB">It affects the speed of the wind. It is greatest at the surface and its influence generally extends upto an elevation of 1 - 3 km. Over the sea surface the friction is minimal.</p>

    <p class="heading3" xml:lang="en-GB">Coriolis Force</p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The rotation of the earth about its axis affects the direction of the wind. This force is called the Coriolis force after the French physicist who described it in 1844. It deflects the wind to the right direction in the northern hemisphere and</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">to the left in</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">the southern hemisphere. The deflection is more when the wind velocity is high. The Coriolis force is directly proportional to the angle of latitude. It is maximum at the poles and is absent at the equator.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The Coriolis force acts perpendicular to the pressure gradient force. The pressure gradient force is perpendicular to an isobar. The higher the pressure gradient force, the more is the</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">velocity of the wind and the larger is the deflection in the direction of wind. As a result of these two forces operating perpendicular to</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">each other, in the low-pressure areas the wind blows around it. At the equator, the Coriolis force is zero and the wind blows perpendicular to the is</span><span xml:lang="en-US">obars. The low pressure gets filled instead of getting intensified. That is the reason why tropical cyclones are not formed near the</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">equator.</span></p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB">The velocity and direction of the wind are the net result of the wind generating forces. The winds in the upper atmosphere, 2 - 3 km above the surface, are free from frictional effect of the surface and are controlled mainly by the pressure gradient and the Coriolis force. When isobars are straight and when there is no friction, the pressure gradient force is balanced by the Coriolis force and the resultant wind blows parallel to the isobar. This wind is known as the geostrophic wind (Figure 10.4).</p>

Generally, over low pressure area the air will converge and rise. Over high pressure area the air will subside from above and diverge at the surface (Figure10.5). Apart from convergence, some eddies, convection currents, orographic uplift and uplift along fronts cause the rising of air, which is essential for the formation of clouds and precipitation.</span></p>

The pattern of the movement of the planetary winds is called the general circulation of the atmosphere. The general circulation of the atmosphere also sets in motion the ocean water circulation which influences the earth’s climate. A schematic description of the general circulation is shown in Figure 10.6.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The air at the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) rises because of convection caused by high insolation and a low pressure is created. The winds from the tropics converge at this low pressure zone. The converged air rises along with the convective cell. It reaches the top of the troposphere up to an altitude of 14 km. and moves towards the poles. This causes accumulation of air at about 30</span><span class="char-style-override-8" xml:lang="en-US">o</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">N and S. Part of the accumulated air sinks to the ground and forms a subtropical high. Another reason for sinking is the cooling of air when it reaches 30</span><span class="char-style-override-8" xml:lang="en-US">o</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">N and S latitudes. Down below near the land surface the air flows towards the equator as the easterlies. The easterlies from either side of the equator converge in the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Such circulations from the surface upwards and</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">vice-versa</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">are called cells. Such a cell in the tropics is called</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">Hadley Cell</span><span xml:lang="en-US">. In the middle latitudes the circulation is that of sinking cold air that comes from the poles and the rising warm air that blows from the subtropical high. At the surface these winds are called westerlies and the cell is known as the</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">Ferrel cell</span><span xml:lang="en-US">. At polar latitudes the cold dense air subsides near the poles and blows towards middle latitudes as the polar easterlies. This cell is called the polar</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">cell. These three cells set the pattern for the general circulation of the atmosphere. The transfer of heat energy from lower latitudes to higher latitudes maintains the general</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">circulation.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">The general circulation of the atmosphere also affects the oceans. The large-scale winds of the atmosphere initiate large and slow moving currents of the ocean. Oceans in turn provide input of energy and water vapour into the air. These interactions take place rather slowly over a large part of the ocean.</p>

    <p class="para-style-override-14" xml:lang="en-GB">Warming and cooling of the Pacific Ocean is most important in terms of general atmospheric circulation. The warm water of the central Pacific Ocean slowly drifts towards South American coast and replaces the cool Peruvian current. Such appearance of warm water off the coast of Peru is known as the El Nino. The El Nino event is closely associated with the pressure changes in the Central Pacific and Australia. This change in pressure condition over Pacific is known as the southern oscillation. The combined phenomenon of southern oscillation and El Nino is known as ENSO. In the years when the ENSO is strong, large-scale variations in weather occur over the world. The arid west coast of South America receives heavy rainfall, drought occurs in Australia and sometimes in India and floods in China. This phenomenon is closely monitored and is used for long range forecasting in major parts of the world.</p></div>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The pattern of wind circulation is modified in different seasons due to the shifting of regions of maximum heating, pressure and wind belts.

During the day the land heats up faster and becomes warmer than the sea. Therefore, over the land the air</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">rises giving rise to a low pressure area, whereas the sea is relatively cool and the pressure over sea is relatively high. Thus, pressure gradient from sea to land is created and the wind blows from the sea to the land as the sea breeze. In the night the reversal of condition takes place. The land loses heat faster and is cooler than the sea. The pressure gradient is from the land to the sea and hence land breeze results (Figure 10.7).</span></p>

The cool air, of the high plateaus and ice fields draining into the valley is called katabatic wind. Another type of warm wind occurs on the leeward side of the mountain ranges. The moisture in these winds, while crossing the mountain ranges condense and precipitate. When it descends down the leeward side of the slope the dry air gets warmed up by adiabatic process. This dry air may melt the snow in a short time.</span></p>

    <p class="heading3" xml:lang="en-GB">Air Masses</p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB">When the air remains over a homogenous area for a sufficiently longer time, it acquires the characteristics of the area. The homogenous regions can be the vast ocean surface or vast plains. The air with distinctive characteristics in terms of temperature and humidity is called an airmass. It is defined as a large body of air having little horizontal variation in temperature and moisture. The homogenous surfaces, over which air masses form, are called the source regions.</p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The air masses are classified according to the source regions. There are five major source</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">regions.

Accordingly, following types of air-masses are recognised: (i) Maritime tropical (mT); (ii) Continental tropical (cT); (iii) Maritime polar (mP); (iv) Continental polar (cP);<br/>
    (v) Continental arctic (cA). Tropical air masses are warm and polar air masses are cold.</span></p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The systems developing in the mid and high latitude, beyond the tropics are called the</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">middle latitude or extra tropical cyclones</span><span xml:lang="en-US">. The passage of front causes abrupt changes in the weather conditions over the area in the middle and high latitudes.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">Extra tropical cyclones form along the polar front. Initially, the front is stationary. In the northern hemisphere, warm air blows from the south and cold air from the north of the front. When the pressure drops along the front, the warm air moves northwards and the cold air move towards, south setting in motion an anticlockwise cyclonic circulation. The cyclonic circulation leads to a well developed extra tropical cyclone, with a warm front and a cold front. The plan and cross section of a well developed cyclone is given in Figure 10.9. There are pockets of warm air or warm sector wedged between the forward and the rear cold air or cold sector. The warm air glides over the cold air and a sequence of clouds appear over the sky ahead of the warm front and cause precipitation. The cold front approaches the warm air from behind and pushes the warm air up. As a result, cumulus clouds develop along the cold front. The cold front moves faster than the warm front ultimately overtaking the warm front. The warm air is completely lifted up and the front is occluded and the cyclone dissipates.</p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The processes of wind circulation both at the surface and aloft are closely interlinked. The extra tropical cyclone differs from the tropical cyclone in number of ways. The extra tropical cyclones have a clear frontal system</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">which is not present in the tropical cyclones. They cover a larger area and can originate over the land and sea. Whereas the tropical cyclones originate only over the seas and on reaching the land they dissipate. The extra tropical cyclone affects a much larger area as compared to the tropical cyclone. The wind velocity in a tropical cyclone is much higher and it is more destructive. The extra tropical cyclones move from west to east but tropical cyclones, move from east to west.</span></p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">Tropical cyclones are violent storms that</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">originate over oceans in tropical areas and move over to the coastal areas bringing about large scale destruction caused by violent winds, very heavy rainfall and storm surges. This is one of the most devastating natural calamities. They are known as</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">Cyclones</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">in the Indian Ocean,</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">Hurricanes</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">in the Atlantic,</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">Typhoons</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">in the Western Pacific and South China Sea, and</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">Willy-willies</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">in the Western Australia.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">Tropical cyclones originate and intensify over warm tropical oceans. The conditions favourable for the formation and intensification of tropical storms are: (i) Large sea surface with temperature higher than 27° C; (ii) Presence of the Coriolis force; (iii) Small variations in the vertical wind speed; (iv) A pre-existing weak-low-pressure area or low-level-cyclonic circulation; (v) Upper divergence above the sea level system.</p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The energy that intensifies the storm, comes from the condensation process in the towering cumulonimbus clouds, surrounding the centre of the storm. With continuous supply of moisture from the sea, the storm is further strengthened. On reaching the land the moisture supply is cut off and the storm dissipates. The place where a tropical cyclone crosses the coast is called the landfall of the cyclone. The cyclones, which cross 20</span><span class="char-style-override-8" xml:lang="en-US">o</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">N latitude generally, recurve and they are more destructive.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">A schematic representation of the vertical struc</span><span xml:lang="en-US">ture of a mature tropical cyclonic storm is shown in Figure 10.10.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">A mature tropical cyclone is characterised by the strong spirally circulating wind around the centre, called the eye. The diameter of the circulating system can vary between 150 and 250 km.</p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The eye is a region of calm with subsiding air. Around the eye is the eye wall, where there is a strong spiralling ascent of air to greater height reaching the tropopause. The wind reaches maximum velocity in this region, reaching as high as 250 km per hour. Torrential rain occurs here. From the eye wall rain bands may radiate and trains of cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds may drift into the outer region. The diameter of the storm over the B</span><span xml:lang="en-US">ay of Bengal, Arabian sea and Indian ocean is between 600 - 1200 km. The system moves slowly about 300 - 500 km per day. The cyclone creates storm surges and they inundate the coas</span><span xml:lang="en-US">tal low lands. The storm peters out on the land.</span></p>

    <p class="heading3 para-style-override-15" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">Thundersto</span><span xml:lang="en-US">rms and Tornadoes</span></p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">Other severe local storms are thunderstorms and tornadoes. They are of short duration, occurring over a small area but are violent.</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">Thunderstorms</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">are caused by intense convection on moist hot days. A thunderstorm is a well-grown cumulonimbus cloud producing thunder and lightening. When the clouds extend to heights where sub-zero temperature prevails, hails are formed and they come down as hailstorm. If there is insufficient moisture, a thunderstorm can generate dust-storms. A thunderstorm is characterised by intense updraft of rising warm air, which causes the clouds to grow bigger and rise to greater height. This causes precipitation. Later, downdraft brings down to earth the cool air and the rain. From severe thunderstorms sometimes spiralling wind descends like a trunk of an elephant with great force, with very low pressure at the centre, causing massive destruction on its way. Such a phenomenon is called a</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">tornado</span><span xml:lang="en-US">. Tornadoes generally occur in middle latitudes. The tornado over the sea is called</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">water sprouts</span><span xml:lang="en-US">.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">These violent storms are the manifestation of the atmosphere’s adjustments to varying energy distribution. The potential and heat energies are converted into kinetic energy in these storms and the restless atmosphere again returns to its stable state.</p>
