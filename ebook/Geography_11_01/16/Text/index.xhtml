          <span class="char-style-override-1">Y</span><span xml:lang="en-US">ou have already learnt about the</span> <span style="text-align: justify;">geomorphic processes particularly</span> <span style="text-align: justify;">weathering and depth of weathering mantle in different climatic zones. See the Figure 6.2 in Chapter 6 in order to recapitulate. You should know that this weathering mantle is the basis for the diversity of vegetation and hence, the biodiversity. The basic cause for such weathering variations and resultant biodiversity is the input of solar energy and water. No wonder that the areas that are rich in these inputs are the areas of wide spectrum of biodiversity.</span>
        </div>

        <p class="box para-style-override-2" xml:lang="en-GB">Biodiversity as we have today is the result of 2.5-3.5 billion years of evolution. Before the advent of humans, our earth supported more biodiversity than in any other period. Since, the emergence of humans, however, biodiversity has begun a rapid decline, with one species after another bearing the brunt of extinction due to overuse. The number of species globally vary from 2 million to 100 million, with 10 million being the best estimate. New species are regularly discovered most of which are yet to be classified (an estimate states that about 40 per cent of fresh water fishes from South America are not classified yet). Tropical forests are very rich in bio-diversity.</p>

        <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">Biodiversity is a system in constant evolution, from a view point of species, as well as from view point of an individual organism. The average half-life of a species is estimated at between one and four million years, and 99 per cent of the species that have ever lived on the earth are today extinct. Biodiversity is not found evenly on the earth. It is consistently richer in the tropics. As one approaches the polar regions, one finds larger and larger populations of fewer and fewer species.</p>

        <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">Biodiversity itself is a combination of two words,</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">Bio</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">(life) and</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">diversity</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">(variety). In simple terms, biodiversity is the number and variety of organisms found within a specified geographic region. It refers to the varieties of plants, animals and micro-organisms, the genes they contain and the ecosystems they form. It relates to the variability among living organisms on the earth, including the variability within and between the species and that within and between the ecosystems. Biodiversity is our living wealth. It is a result of hundreds of millions of years of evolutionary history.</span></p>

        <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">Biodiversity can be discussed at three levels</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">: (i) Genetic diversity; (ii) Species diversity; (iii) Ecosystem diversity.</span></p>

        <h4 class="heading2" xml:lang="en-GB">Importance of Biodiversity</h4>

        <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB">Biodiversity has contributed in many ways to the development of human culture and, in turn, human communities have played a major role in shaping the diversity of nature at the genetic, species and ecological levels. Biodiversity plays the following roles: ecological, economic and scientific.</p>

        <h4 class="heading2" xml:lang="en-GB"><br/></h4>

        <h4 class="heading2" xml:lang="en-GB">Ecological Role of Biodiversity</h4>

        <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB">Species of many kinds perform some function or the other in an ecosystem. Nothing in an ecosystem evolves and sustains without any reason. That means, every organism, besides extracting its needs, also contributes something of useful to other organisms. Can you think of the way we, humans contribute to the sustenance of ecosystems. Species capture and store energy, produce and decompose organic materials, help to cycle water and nutrients throughout the ecosystem, fix atmospheric gases and help regulate the climate. These functions are important for ecosystem function and human survival. The more diverse an ecosystem, better are the chances for the species to survive through adversities and attacks, and consequently, is more productive. Hence, the loss of species would decrease the ability of the system to maintain itself. Just like a species with a high genetic diversity, an ecosystem with high biodiversity may have a greater chance of adapting to environmental change. In other words, the more the variety of species in an ecosystem, the more stable the ecosystem is likely to be.</p>

        <h4 class="heading2" xml:lang="en-GB"><br/></h4>

        <h4 class="heading2" xml:lang="en-GB">Economic Role of Biodiversity</h4>

        <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB">For all humans, biodiversity is an important resource in their day-to-day life. One important part of biodiversity is ‘crop diversity’, which is also called agro-biodiversity. Biodiversity is seen as a reservoir of resources to be drawn upon for the manufacture of food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic products. This concept of biological resources is responsible for the deterioration of biodiversity. At the same time, it is also the origin of new conflicts dealing with rules of division and appropriation of natural resources. Some of the important economic commodities that biodiversity supplies to humankind are: food<br/>
        crops, livestock, forests, fish, medicinal resources, etc.</p>

        <h4 class="heading2" xml:lang="en-GB"><br/></h4>

        <h4 class="heading2" xml:lang="en-GB">Scientific Role of Biodiversity</h4>

        <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">Biodiversity is important because each species can give us some clue as to how life evolved and will continue to evolve. Biodiversity also helps in understanding how life functions and the role of each species in su</span><span xml:lang="en-US">staining ecosyste</span><span xml:lang="en-US">ms of which we are also a species. This fact must be drawn upon every one of us so that we live and let other species also live their lives.</span></p>

        <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">It is our ethical responsibility to consider that each and every species along with us have an intrinsic right to exist. Hence, it is morally wrong to voluntarily cause the extinction of any species. The level of biodiversity is a good indicator of the state of our relationships with other living species. In fact, the concept of biodiversity is an integral part of many human cultures.</p>

        <h4 class="heading1" xml:lang="en-GB"><br/></h4>

        <h6 class="heading1" xml:lang="en-GB">Loss of Biodiversity</h6>

        <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB">Since the last few decades, growth in human population has increased the rate of consumption of natural resources. It has accelerated the loss of species and habitation in different parts of the world. Tropical regions which occupy only about one-fourth of the total area of the world, contain about three-fourth of the world human population. Over-exploitation of resources and deforestation have become rampant to fulfil the needs of large population. As these tropical rain forests contain 50 per cent of the species on the earth, destruction of natural habitats have proved disastrous for the entire biosphere.</p>

        <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">Natural calamities such as earthquakes, floods, volcanic eruptions, forest fires, droughts, etc. cause damage to the flora and fauna of the earth, bringing change the biodiversity of respective affected regions. Pesticides and other pollutants such as hydrocarbons and toxic heavy metals destroy the weak and sensitive species. Species which are not the natural inhabitants of the local habitat but are introduced into the system, are called</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">exotic species</span><span xml:lang="en-US">. There are many examples when a natural biotic community of the ecosystem suffered extensive damage because of the introduction of exotic species. During the last few decades, some animals like tigers, elephants, rhinoceros, crocodiles, minks and birds were hunted mercilessly by poachers for their horn, tusks, hides, etc. It has resulted in the rendering of certain types of organisms as endangered category.</span></p>

        <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">The International Union of Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) has classified the threatened species of plants and animals into three categories for the purpose of their conservation.</p>
