    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB">You have been reading about ecological and environmental problems in newspapers and magazines. Have you ever thought what ecology is? The environment as you know, is made up of abiotic and biotic components. It would be interesting to understand how the diversity of life-forms is maintained to bring a kind of balance. This balance is maintained in a particular proportion so that a healthy interaction between the biotic and the abiotic components goes on.</p>

    <p class="Body-text"><span xml:lang="en-US">The interactions of a particular group of organisms with abiotic factors within a particular habitat resulting in clearly defined energy flows and material cycles on land, water and air, are called</span> <span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">ecological systems</span><span>.</span></p>

Further, the secondary consumers are consumed by the tertiary consumers. The decomposers feed on the dead at each and every level. They change them into various substances such as nutrients, organic and inorganic salts essential for soil fertility. Organisms of an ecosystem are linked together through a foodchain (Figure 15.1). For example, a plant eating beetle feeding on a paddy stalk is eaten by a frog, which is, in turn, eaten by a snake, which is then consumed by a hawk. This sequence of eating and being eaten and the resultant transfer of energy from one level to another is known as the</span> <span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">food-chain</span><span xml:lang="en-US">. Transfer of energy that occurs during the process of a foodchain from one level to another is known as</span> <span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">flow of energy</span><span xml:lang="en-US">. However, food-chains are not isolated from one another. For example, a mouse feeding on grain may be eaten by different secondary consumers (carnivores) and these carnivores may be eaten by other different tertiary consumers (top carnivores). In such situations, each of the carnivores may consume more than one type of prey. As a result, the food- chains get interlocked with one another. This inter-connecting network of species is known as</span> <span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">food web.</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">Generally, two types of food-chains are recognised:</span> <span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">grazing food-chain</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">and</span> <span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">detritus</span> <span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">food-chain</span><span xml:lang="en-US">. In a grazing food-chain, the first level starts with plants as producers and ends with carnivores as consumers at the last level, with the herbivores being at the intermediate level. There is a loss of energy at each level which may be through respiration, excretion or decomposition. The levels involved in a food-chain range between three to five and energy is lost at each level. A detritus food-chain is based on autotrophs energy capture initiated by grazing animals and involves the decomposition or breaking down of organic wastes and dead matter derived from the grazing food-chain.</span></p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The sun is the basic source of energy on which all life depends. This energy initiates life processes in the biosphere through photosynthesis, the main source of food and</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">energy for green plants. During</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is converted into organic compounds and oxygen. Out of the total solar insolation that reaches the earth’s surface, only a very small fraction (0.1 per cent) is fixed in photosynthesis. More than half is used for plant respiration and the remaining part is temporarily stored or is shifted to other portions of the plant.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">Life on earth consists of a great variety of living organisms. These living organisms exist and survive in a diversity of associations. Such survival involves the presence of systemic flows such as flows of energy, water and nutrients. These flows show variations in different parts of the world, in different seasons of the year and under varying local circumstances. Studies have shown that for the last one billion years, the atmosphere and hydrosphere have been composed of approximately the same balance of chemical components. This balance of the chemical elements is maintained by a cyclic passage through the tissues of plants and animals. The cycle starts by absorbing the chemical elements by the organism and is returned to the air, water and soil through decomposition. These cycles are largely energised by solar insolation. These cyclic movements of chemical elements of the biosphere between the organism and the environment are referred to as</span> <span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">biogeochemical cycles</span><span xml:lang="en-US">.</span> <span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">Bio</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">refers to living organisms and</span> <span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">geo</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">to rocks, soil, air and water of the earth.</span></p>

    <p class="heading3" xml:lang="en-GB">The Carbon Cycle</p>

    <p class="First-para-indent"><span xml:lang="en-US">Carbon is one of the basic elements of all living organisms. It forms the basic constituent of all the organic compounds. The biosphere contains over half a million carbon compounds in them. The carbon cycle is mainly the conversion of carbon dioxide. This conversion is initiated by the fixation of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through</span> <span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">photosynthesis</span><span>. Such conversion results in the production of carbohydrate, glucose that may be converted to other organic compounds such as sucrose, starch, cellulose, etc. Here, some of the carbohydrates are utilised directly by the plant itself. During this process, more carbon dioxide is generated and is released through its leaves or roots during the day. The remaining carbohydrates not being utilised by the plant become part of the plant tissue. Plant tissues are either being eaten by the herbivorous animals or get decomposed by the micro-organisms. The herbivores convert some of the consumed carbohydrates into carbon dioxide for release into the air through respiration. The micro-organisms decompose the remaining carbohydrates after the animal dies.</span></p>

It is involved in the oxidation of carbohydrates with the release of energy, carbon dioxide and water. The cycling of oxygen is a highly complex process. Oxygen occurs in a number of chemical forms and combinations. It combines with nitrogen to form nitrates and with many other minerals and elements to form various oxides such as the iron oxide, aluminium oxide and others. Much of oxygen is produced from the decomposition of water molecules by sunlight</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">d</span><span xml:lang="en-US">uring photosynthesis and is released in the atmosphere through transpiration and respiration processes of plants.</span></p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">Nitrogen is a major constituent of the atmosphere comprising about seventy-nine per cent of the atmospheric gases. It is also an essential constituent of different organic compounds such as the amino acids, nucleic acids, proteins, vitamins and pigments. Only a few types of organisms like certain species of soil bacteria and blue green algae are capable of utilising it directly in its gaseous form. Generally, nitrogen is usable only after it is fixed. N</span><span xml:lang="en-US">inety per cent of fixed nitrogen is biological. The principal source of free nitrogen is the action of soil micro-organisms and associated plant roots on atmospheric nitrogen found in pore spaces of the soil. Nitrogen can also be fixed in the atmosphere by lightning and cosmic radiation. In the oceans, some marine animals can fix it. After atmospheric nitrogen has been fixed into an available form,</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">green plants can assimilate it. Herbivorous animals feeding on plants, in turn, consume some of it. Dead plants and animals, excretion of nitrogenous wastes are converted into nitrites by the action of bacteria present in the soil. Some bacteria can even convert nitrites into nitrates that can be used again by green plants. There are still other types of bacteria capable of converting nitrates into free nitrogen, a process known as</span> <span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">denitrification</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">(Figure 15.3).</span></p>

    <p class="heading3" xml:lang="en-GB">Other Mineral Cycles</p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB">Other than carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen being the principal geochemical components of the biosphere, many other minerals also occur as critical nutrients for plant and animal life. These mineral elements required by living organisms are obtained initially from inorganic sources such as phosphorus, sulphur, calcium and potassium. They usually occur as salts dissolved in soil water or lakes, streams and seas. Mineral salts come directly from the earth’s crust by weathering where the soluble salts enter the water cycle, eventually reaching the sea. Other salts are returned to the earth’s surface through sedimentation, and after weathering, they again enter the cycle. All living organisms fulfill their mineral requirements from mineral solutions in their environments. Other animals receive their mineral needs from the plants and animals they consume. After the death of living organisms, the minerals are returned to the soil and water through decomposition and flow.</p>

    <h4 class="heading2" xml:lang="en-GB">Ecological Balance</h4>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">Ecological balance</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">is a state of dynamic equilibrium within a community of organisms in a habitat or ecosystem. It can happen when the diversity of the living organisms remains relatively stable. Gradual changes do take place but that happens only through natural succession. It can also be explained as a stable balance in the numbers of each species in an ecosystem. This occurs through competition and cooperation between different organisms where population remains stable. This balance is brought about by the fact that certain species compete with one another determined by the environment in which they grow. This balance is also attained by the fact that some species depend on others for their food and sustenance. Such accounts are encountered in vast grasslands where the herbivorous animals (deer, zebras, buffaloes, etc.) are found in plenty. On the other hand, the carnivorous animals (tigers, lions, etc.) that are not usually in large numbers, hunt and feed on the herbivores, thereby controlling their population. In the plants, any disturbance in the native forests such as clearing the forest for shifting cultivation usually brings about a change in the species distribution. This change is due to competition where the secondary forest species such as grasses, bamboos or</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">pines overtakes the native species changing the</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">original forest structure. This is called</span> <span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">succession</span><span xml:lang="en-US">.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">Ecological balance may be disturbed due to the introduction of new species, natural hazards or human causes. Human interference has affected the balance of plant communities leading to disturbances in the ecosystems. Such disturbances bring about numerous secondary successions. Human pressure on the earth’s resources has put a heavy toll on the ecosystem. This has destroyed its originality and has caused adverse effects to the general</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">environment. Ecological imbalances have</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">brought many natural calamities like floods,</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">landslides, diseases, erratic climatic</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">occurrences,</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">etc.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">There is a very close relationship between the plant and animal communities within particular habitats. Diversity of life in a particular area can be employed as an indicator of the habitat factor. Proper knowledge and understanding of such factors provide a strong base for protecting and conserving the ecosystems.</span></p>
