Do you know that we live at the bottom of a huge pile of air? We inhale and exhale but we feel the air when it is in motion. It means air in motion is wind. You have already learnt about the fact that earth is surrounded by air all around. This envelop of air is atmosphere which is composed of numerous gases. These gases support life over the earth’s surface.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">The earth receives almost all of its energy from the sun. The earth in turn radiates back to space the energy received from the sun. As a result, the earth neither warms up nor does it get cooled over a period of time. Thus, the amount of heat received by different parts of the earth is not the same. This variation causes pressure differences in the atmosphere. This leads to transfer of heat from one region to the other by winds. This chapter explains the process of heating and cooling of the atmosphere and the resultant temperature distribution over the earth’s surface.</p>

    <h6 class="heading1 para-style-override-2" xml:lang="en-GB">Solar Radiation</h6>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The earth’s surface receives most of its energy in short wavelengths. The energy received by the earth is known as incoming solar radiation which in short is termed as</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">insolation</span><span xml:lang="en-US">.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">As the earth is a geoid resembling a sphere, the sun’s rays fall obliquely at the top of the atmosphere and the earth intercepts a very small portion of the sun’s energy. On an average the earth receives 1.94 calories per sq. cm per minute at the top of its atmosphere. The solar output received at the top of the atmosphere varies slightly in a year due to the variations in the distance between the earth and the sun. During its revolution around the sun, the earth is farthest from the sun (152 million km) on 4th July. This position of the earth is called</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">aphelion</span><span xml:lang="en-US">. On 3rd January, the earth is the nearest to the sun (147 million km). This position is called</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">perihelion</span><span xml:lang="en-US">. Therefore, the annual insolation received by the earth on 3rd January is slightly more than the amount received on 4th July. However, the effect of this variation in the solar output is masked by other factors like the distribution of land and sea and the atmospheric circulation. Hence, this variation in the solar output does not have great effect on daily weather changes on the surface of the earth.</span></p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The amount and the intensity of insolation vary during a day, in a season and in a year. The factors that cause these variations in insolation are : (i) the rotation of earth on its axis; (ii) the angle of inclination of the sun’s rays; (iii) the length of the day; (iv) the transparency of the atmosphere; (v) the configuration of land in terms of its aspect. The last two however, have less influence.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text"><span xml:lang="en-US">T</span><span xml:lang="en-US">he fact that the earth’s axis makes an angle of 66½ with the plane of its orbit round the sun has a greater influence on the amount of insolation received at different latitudes.</span></p>

    <p class="shoulder para-style-override-8" xml:lang="en-GB">The atmosphere is largely transparent to short wave solar radiation. The incoming solar radiation passes through the atmosphere before striking the earth’s surface. Within the troposphere water vapour, ozone and other gases absorb much of the near infrared radiation.</p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">Very small-suspended particles in the troposphere scatter visible spectrum both to the space and towards the earth surface. This process adds colour to the sky. The red colour of the rising and the setting sun and the blue colour of the sky are the result of scattering of light within the atmosphere.</p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The insolation received at the surface varies from about 320 Watt/m</span><span class="char-style-override-6" xml:lang="en-US">2</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">in the tropics to about 70 Watt/m</span><span class="char-style-override-6" xml:lang="en-US">2</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">in the poles. Maximum insolation is received over the subtropical deserts, where the cloudiness is the least. Equator receives comparatively less insolation than the tropics.

In winter, the middle and higher latitudes receive less radiation than in summer.</span></p>

    <h6 class="heading1" xml:lang="en-GB">Heating and Cooling of Atmosphere</h6>

    <p class="Body-text para-style-override-9" xml:lang="en-GB">There are different ways of heating and cooling of the atmosphere.</p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The earth after being heated by insolation transmits the heat to the atmospheric layers near to the earth in long wave form. The air in contact with the land gets heated slowly and the upper layers in contact with the lower layers also get heated. This process is called</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">conduction</span><span xml:lang="en-US">. Conduction takes place when two bodies of unequal temperature are in contact with one another, there is a flow of energy from the warmer to cooler body. The transfer of heat continues until both the bodies attain the same temperature or the contact is broken. Conduction is important in heating the lower layers of the atmosphere.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The air in contact with the earth rises vertically on heating in the form of currents and further transmits the heat of the atmsphere. This process of vertical heating of the atmosphere is known as</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">convection</span><span xml:lang="en-US">. The convective transfer of energy is confined only to the troposphere.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The transfer of heat through horizontal movement of air i</span><span xml:lang="en-US">s called</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">advection</span><span xml:lang="en-US">. Horizontal</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">movement of the air is relatively more important</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">than the vertical movement. In middle</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">latitudes, most of dirunal (day and night) variation in daily weather are caused by advection alone. In tropical regions particularly in northern India during summer season local winds called ‘loo’ is the outcome of advection process.</span></p>

    <p class="heading2" xml:lang="en-GB"><br/></p>

    <h4 class="heading2" xml:lang="en-GB">Terrestrial Radiation</h4>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB">The insolation received by the earth is in short waves forms and heats up its surface. The earth after being heated itself becomes a radiating body and it radiates energy to the atmosphere in long wave form. This energy heats up the atmosphere from below. This process is known as terrestrial radiation.</p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">The long wave radiation is absorbed by the atmospheric gases particularly by carbon dioxide and the other green house gases. Thus, the atmosphere is indirectly heated by the earth’s radiation.</p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">The atmosphere in turn radiates and</span> <span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">transmits heat to the space. Finally the amount of heat received from the sun is returned to</span> <span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">space, thereby maintaining constant</span> <span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">temperature at the earth’s surface and in the atmosphere.</span></p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.2 depicts the heat budget of the planet earth. T</span><span xml:lang="en-US">he earth as a whole does not accumulate or loose heat. It maintains its temperature. This can happen only if the amount of heat received in the form of insolation equals the amount lost by the earth through terrestrial radiation.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text"><span xml:lang="en-US">Consider that the insolation received at the top of the atmosphere is 100 per cent. While passing through the atmosphere some amount of energy is reflected, scattered and absorbed. Only the remaining part reaches the earth surface. Roughly 35 units are reflected back to space even before reaching the earth’s surface. Of these, 27 units are reflected back from the top of the clouds and 2 units from the snow and ice-covered areas of the earth. The reflected amount of radiation is called the</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">albedo of the earth</span><span>.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The remaining 65 units are absorbed, 14 units within the atmosphere and 51 units by the earth’s surface. The earth radiates back 51 units in the form of terrestrial radiation. Of these, 17 units are radiated to space directly and the remaining 34 units are absorbed by the atmosphere (6 units absorbed directly by the atmosphere, 9 units through convection and turbulence and 19 units through latent heat of condensation).</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">48 units absorbed by the atmosphere<br/>
    (14 units from insolation +34 units from terrestrial radiation) are also radiated back into space. Thus, the total radiation returning from the earth and the atmosphere respectively is 17+48=65 units which balance the total of 65 units received from the sun. This is termed the heat budget or heat balance of the earth.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">This explains, why the earth neither warms up nor cools down despite the huge transfer of heat that takes place.</p>

    <p class="heading3" xml:lang="en-GB">Variation in the Net Heat Budget at the Earth’s Surface</p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB">As explained earlier, there are variations in the amount of radiation received at the earth’s surface. Some part of the earth has surplus radiation balance while the other part has deficit.</p>

    <p class="Body-text">Figure 9.3 depicts the latitudinal variation in the net radiation balance of the earth — the atmosphere system.</p>

    <p class="Body-text">The figure shows that there is a surplus of net radiation balance between 40 degrees north and south and the regions near the poles have a deficit.

    <h4 class="heading2" xml:lang="en-GB">Temperature</h4>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The interaction of insolation with the atmosphere and the earth’s surface creates heat which is measured in terms of temperature. While heat represents the molecular movement of particles comprising a</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">substance, the temperature is the</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">measurement in degrees of how hot (or cold) a thing (or a place) is.</span></p>

    <p class="heading3" xml:lang="en-GB">Factors Controlling Temperature Distribution</p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The temperature of air at any place is</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">influenced by (i) the latitude of the place; (ii) the altitude of the place; (iii) distance from the sea, the air-mass circulation; (iv) the presence of warm and cold ocean currents; (v) local aspects.</span></p>

    <p class="heading4" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">The latitude :</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">The temperature of a place depends on the insolation received. It has been explained earlier that the insolation varies according to the latitude hence the temperature also varies accordingly.</span></p>

    <p class="heading4" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">The altitude :</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">The atmosphere is indirectly heated by terrestrial radiation from below. Therefore, the places near the sea-level record higher temperature than the places situated at higher elevations. In other words, the temperature generally decreases with increasing height. The rate of decrease of temperature with height is termed as the normal lapse rate. It is 6.5°C per 1,000 m.</span></p>

    <p class="heading4" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">Distance from the sea</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">: Another factor that influences the temperature is the location of a place with respect to the sea. Compared to land, the sea gets heated slowly and loses heat slowly. Land heats up and cools down quickly. Therefore, the variation in temperature over the sea is less compared to land. The places situated near the sea come under the moderating influence of the sea and land breezes which moderate the temperature.</span></p>

    <p class="heading4" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">Air-mass and Ocean currents</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">: Like the land and sea breezes, the passage of air masses also affects the temperature. The places, which come under the influence of warm air-masses experience higher temperature and the places that come under the influence of cold air-masses experience low temperature. Similarly, the places located on the coast where the warm ocean currents flow record higher temperature than the places located on the coast where the cold currents flow.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text para-style-override-9" xml:lang="en-GB">Normally, temperature decreases with increase in elevation. It is called normal lapse rate. At times, the situations is reversed and the normal lapse rate is inverted. It is called Inversion of temperature. Inversion is usually of short duration but quite common nonetheless. A long winter night with clear skies and still air is ideal situation for inversion. The heat of the day is radiated off during the night, and by early morning hours, the earth is cooler than the air above. Over polar areas, temperature inversion is normal throughout the year.</p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB">Surface inversion promotes stability in the lower layers of the atmosphere. Smoke and dust particles get collected beneath the inversion layer and spread horizontally to fill the lower strata of the atmosphere. Dense fogs in mornings are common occurrences especially during winter season. This inversion commonly lasts for few hours until the sun comes up and beings to warm the earth.</p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The inversion takes place in hills and mountains due to air drainage. Cold air at the hills and mountains, produced during night, flows under the influence of gravity. Being heavy and dense, the cold air acts almost like water and moves down the slope to pile up deeply in pockets and valley bottoms with warm air above. This is called</span> <span class="char-style-override-4" xml:lang="en-US">air drainage.</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">It protects plants from frost damages.</span></p>
