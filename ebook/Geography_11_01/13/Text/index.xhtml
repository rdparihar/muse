The hydrological cycle describes the movement of water on, in, and above the earth. The water cycle has been working for billions of years and all the life on earth depends on it. Next to air, water is the most important element required for the existence of life on earth. The distribution of water on earth is quite uneven.

The</span> <span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">hydrological cycle</span><span xml:lang="en-US">, is the circulation of water within the earth’s hydrosphere in different forms i.e. the liquid, solid and the gaseous phases.

    <p class="Body-text">Table 13.1 shows distribution of water on the surface of the earth. About 71 per cent of the planetary water is found in the oceans. The remaining is held as freshwater in glaciers and icecaps, groundwater sources, lakes, soil moisture, atmosphere, streams and within life. Nearly 59 per cent of the water that falls on land returns to the atmosphere through evaporation from over the oceans as well as from other places. The remainder runs-off on the surface, infiltrates into the ground or a part of it becomes glacier (Figure 13.1).</p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The oceans are confined to the great depressions of the earth’s outer layer. In this section, we shall see the nature of the ocean basins of the earth and their topography. The oceans, unlike the continents, merge so naturally into one another that it is hard to</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">demarcate them. The</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">geographers have divided the oceanic part of the earth into five oceans, namely the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian, and Southern ocean the Arctic. The various seas, bays, gulfs and other inlets are parts of these four large oceans.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text"><span xml:lang="en-US">A major portion of the ocean floor is found between 3-6 km below the sea level. The ‘land’ under the waters of the oceans, that is, the ocean floor exhibits complex and varied</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">features as those observed over the land (Figure</span> <span>13.2). The floors of the oceans are rugged with the world’s largest mountain ranges, deepest trenches and the largest plains. These features are formed, like those of the continents, by the factors of tectonic, volcanic and depositional processes.</span></p>

    <h4 class="heading2" xml:lang="en-GB">Divisions of the Ocean Floors</h4>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB">The ocean floors can be divided into four major divisions: (i) the Continental Shelf; (ii) the Continental Slope; (iii) the Deep Sea Plain;<br/>
    (iv) the Oceanic Deeps. Besides, these divisions there are also major and minor relief features in the ocean floors like ridges, hills, sea mounts, guyots, trenches, canyons, etc.</p>

    <p class="heading3 para-style-override-16" xml:lang="en-GB">Continental Shelf</p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB">The continental shelf is the extended margin of each continent occupied by relatively shallow seas and gulfs. It is the shallowest part of the ocean showing an average gradient of<br/>
    1° or even less. The shelf typically ends at a very steep slope, called the shelf break.</p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The widt</span><span xml:lang="en-US">h of t</span><span xml:lang="en-US">he continental shelves vary from one ocean to another. The average width of</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">continental shelves is about 80 km. The shelves are almost absent or very narrow along some of the margins like the coasts of Chile, the west coast of Sumatra, etc. On the contrary, the Siberian shelf in the Arctic Ocean, the largest in the world, stretches to 1,500 km in width. The depth of the shelves also varies. It may be as shallow as 30 m in some areas while in some areas it is as deep as 600 m.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The continental shelves are covered with variable thicknesses of sediments brought down by rivers, glaciers, wind, from the land and distributed by waves and currents. Massive sedimentary deposits received over a long time by the continental shelves, become the source of fossil fuels.</span></p>

    <p class="heading3" xml:lang="en-GB">Continental Slope</p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The continental slope connects the continental shelf and the ocean basins. It begins where the bottom of the continental shelf sharply drops off into a steep slope. The gradient of the slope region varies between 2-5°. The depth of the slope region varies between 200 and 3,000 m. The slope boundary indicates the end of the continents. Canyons and trenches are observed in this region.</span></p>

    <p class="heading3 para-style-override-17" xml:lang="en-GB">Deep Sea Plain</p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">Deep sea plains are gently sloping areas of the ocean basins. These are the flattest and smoothest regions of the world. The depths vary between 3,000 and 6,000m. These plains are covered with fine-grained sediments like clay and silt.</span></p>

    <p class="heading3 para-style-override-17" xml:lang="en-GB">Oceanic Deeps or Trenches</p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB">These areas are the deepest parts of the oceans. The trenches are relatively steep sided, narrow basins. They are some 3-5 km deeper than the surrounding ocean floor. They occur at the bases of continental slopes and along island arcs and are associated with active volcanoes and strong earthquakes. That is why they are very significant in the study of plate movements. As many as 57 deeps have been explored so far; of which 32 are in the Pacific Ocean; 19 in the Atlantic Ocean and 6 in the Indian Ocean.</p>

    <p class="heading3 para-style-override-17" xml:lang="en-GB">Mid-Oceanic Ridges</p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">A mid-oceanic ridge is composed of two chains of mountains separated by a large depression. The mountain ranges can have peaks as high as 2,500 m and some even reach above the ocean’s surface. Iceland, a part of the mid-Atlantic Ridge, is an example.</span></p>

    <p class="heading3" xml:lang="en-GB">Seamount</p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">It is a mou</span><span xml:lang="en-US">ntain with pointed summits, rising from the seafloor that does not reach the surface of the ocean. Seamounts are volcanic in origin. These can be 3,000-4,500 m tall. The Emperor seamount, an extension of the Hawaiian Is</span><span xml:lang="en-US">lands in the Pacific Ocean, is a good example.</span></p>

    <p class="heading3" xml:lang="en-GB">Submarine Canyons</p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">These are deep valleys, some comparable to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado river. They are sometimes found cutting across the continental shelves and slopes, often extending from the mouths of large rivers. The Hudson Canyon is the best known submarine canyon in the world.</span></p>

    <p class="heading3" xml:lang="en-GB">Guyots</p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB">It is a flat topped seamount. They show evidences of gradual subsidence through stages to become flat topped submerged mountains. It is estimated that more than 10,000 seamounts and guyots exist in the Pacific Ocean alone.</p>

    <p class="heading3" xml:lang="en-GB">Atoll</p>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">These are low islands found in the tropical oceans consisting of coral reefs surrounding a central depression.

    <p class="First-para-indent para-style-override-18" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">(iii)</span> <span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">Prevailing wind</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">: the winds blowing from the land towards the oceans drive warm surface water away form the coast resulting in the upwelling of cold water from below. It results into the longitudinal variation in the temperature. Contrary to this, the onshore winds pile up warm water near the coast and this raises the temperature.</span></p>

    <p class="First-para-indent para-style-override-18" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">(iv)</span> <span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">Ocean currents</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">: warm ocean currents raise the temperature in cold areas while the cold currents decrease the temperature in warm ocean areas. Gulf stream (warm current) raises the temperature near the eastern coast of North America and the West Coast of Europe while the Labrador current (cold current) lowers the temperature near the north-east coast of North America.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">All these factors influence the temperature of the ocean currents locally. The enclosed seas in the low latitudes record relatively higher temperature than the open seas; whereas the enclosed seas in the high latitudes have lower temperature than the open seas.</span></p>

    <p class="First-para-indent"><span xml:lang="en-US">The temperature-depth profile for the ocean water shows how the temperature decreases with the increasing depth.

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The average temperature of surface water of the oceans is about 27°C and it gradually decreases from the equator towards the poles. The rate of decrease of temperature with increasing latitude is generally 0.5°C per latitude. The average temperature is around 22°C at 20° latitudes, 14° C at 40° latitudes and 0° C near poles. The oceans in the northern</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">hemisphere</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">r</span><span xml:lang="en-US">ecord relatively higher temperature than in the southern hemisphere. The highest temperature is not recorded at the equator but slightly towards north of it. The average annual temperatures for the northern and southern hemisphere are around 19° C and 16° C respectively. This variation is due to the unequal distribution of land and water in the northern and southern hemispheres. Figure 13.4 shows the spatial pattern of surface temperature of the oceans.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">It is a well known fact that the maximum temperature of the oceans is always at their surfaces because they directly receive the heat from the sun and the heat is transmitted to the lower sections of the oceans through the process of convection.

The temperature falls very rapidly up to the depth of 20</span><span xml:lang="en-US">0</span><span xml:lang="en-US">m and thereafter, the rate of decrease of temperature is slowed down.</span></p>

    <h4 class="heading2" xml:lang="en-GB">Vertical Distribution of Salinity</h4>

    <p class="First-para-indent" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">Salinity changes with depth, but the way it changes depends upon the location of the sea. Salinity at the surface increases by the loss of water to ice or evaporation, or decreased by the input of fresh waters, such as from the rivers. Salinity at depth is very much fixed, because there is no way that water is ‘lost’, or the salt is ‘added.’ There is a marked difference in the salinity between the surface zones and the deep zones of the oceans. The lower salinity water rests above the higher salinity dense water. Salinity, generally, increases with depth and there is a distinct zone called the</span> <span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">halocline</span><span class="char-style-override-8" xml:lang="en-US">,</span> <span xml:lang="en-US">where salinity increases sharply. Other factors being constant, increasing salinity of seawater causes its density to increase. High salinity seawater, generally, sinks below the lower salinity water. This leads to stratification by salinity.</span></p>
